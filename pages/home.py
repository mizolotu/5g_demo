                As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become a core part of almost every industry, including 5G, 
                there is an increasing concern about the vulnerability of AI/ML to adversarial effects.
                One such vulnerability is related to adversarial example generation during the inference time. 
                An adversary aims to feed such features to the target model that it returns certain wrong output.

                        In the radio access network (RAN) domain, due to the nature of wireless medium, AI/ML based frameworks deployed 
                        may be susceptible to adversaries that manipulate the inputs to the models during the inference stage over the air. 
                        Unless there is a serious flaw in the system, the adversary is not able to manipulate the input data to the target model directly, 
                        however, it can only add its own transmissions on top of existing transmissions over the air to change the input data indirectly.
                        A deep learning solution for fast and accurate initial access (IA) in 5G mmWave networks is proposed by [Cousik et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01847).
                        The IA time consists of two components: time for beam sweeping, i.e. measuring the received signal strengths (RSSs) for different beams, and time for beam prediction, 
                        i.e. identifying the beam for a given transmitter-receiver pair to communicate with. Since the beam sweep time dominates the overall IA time, it is essential to 
                        improve the IA time by utilizing fewer beams.

                        The study attempts to reduce the beam sweep time by measuring RSSs from only a subset of all available beams and 
                        mapping them to the best selection from the entire set of beams. An adversary may search for a perturbation that causes any misclassification at 
                        the receiverâ€™s classifier. In case the beam selected by the classifier is different from the best one, the network throughput may be reduced for 
                        the user under attack. The attack resembles radio jamming, i.e. an adversary uses a fake base station to emit a radio signal on top of existing 
                        transmissions over the air to negatively affect the model output, i.e. the antenna beam selected.
